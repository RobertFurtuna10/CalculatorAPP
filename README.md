3. The possible operations are:
   - +number: adds that number to the current value
   - -number: subtracts the respective number from the current value
   - *number: Multiplies the current value by that number
   - /number: divides the current value by that number
   - =number: sets the current value with that number
   - x: exit the program
4. After each operation, the current value is displayed and user input is again expected.
